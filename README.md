 2. A huspital wants to determine whether there is any difference in average Turm Around Time (TAT) of reports of the labouratories on their preferred list.They collected a random sample and recored TAT for reports of 4 labouratories.TAT as defined as sample collected report dispatch.Analyse the data and determine whether there is any difference in average TAT among the different labouratories at 5% significance level.
